# Meet landing page

![Design preview for the Meet landing page coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**To do this challenge, you need a decent understanding of HTML & CSS.**

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## Where to find everything

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page. For faces you can use images from here [UI Faces](https://uifaces.co/)

The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
